## Querier

This program reads a text file created by the crawler and performs search queries.

## Usage:

The querier is implemented using the 'querier.c' file. It uses the 'index.c' module that is within the 'common' directory. To compile, you can type "make" in the querier directory or "make querier".

Indexer is tested in multiple ways including a 'testing.sh' file and fuzzquery.c. 

Both can be compiled using make or make all. 

## Implementation:

See the implementation spec for more details.
