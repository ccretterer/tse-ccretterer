# CS50 TSE
## Carly Retterer (GitHub username: cccretter)

The assignment and Specs are in a [public repo](https://github.com/CS50Spring2023/labs/tse).
Do not clone that repo; view it on GitHub.
Watch there for any commits that may represent updates to the assignment or specs.

Add here any assumptions you made while writing the crawler, any ways in which your implementation differs from the three Specs, or any ways in which you know your implementation fails to work.

I did not make any assumptions beyond those described in the three Specs for the common directory. My pagedir.h includes the most specific comments regarding my pagedir.c functions and functionality.
